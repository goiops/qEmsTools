\description{
Uses the Trajectory API to retrieve a flight track directly
}
\details{
Sometimes you just want a flight track. This uses the simple trajectories API
to pull a dataframe with just the offset, latitude, longitude and altitude of a flight by second.
Not entirely clear just yet what parameters specifically are used.

\examples{
\dontrun{
flight_track <- pull_kml_flight_track("firstname.lastname", "password", flight_record = 1)
write(flight_track, "flight-track.kml")
